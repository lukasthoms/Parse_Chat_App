# Parse_Chat_App
A basic chat app with a Parse backend. I wrote about the real-time part of the implementation on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@lukasthinks/implementing-real-time-ish-ios-data-in-parse-4c22d5f423dd).

This app was originally written as a way to understand implementing a real-time data model using Parse and push notifications.  It sort of snowballed and as such, most of my logic is done in View Controllers. I realize that's not the ideal place to put a lot of it, but it works, and conveniently makes it a bit easier to understand the logic of the code.

Feel free to message me with any questions you might have!
