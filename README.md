# Parse_Chat_App
A basic chat app with a Parse backend.

This app was originally written as a way to understand implementing a real-time data model using Parse and push notifications. It sort of snowballed and as such, most of my logic is done in View Controllers. I realize that's not the ideal place to put a lot of it, but it works.

Feel free to message me with any questions you might have!
